# Logic Flow - Practice Questions

## Question 1: Conditional Loop
Create a for loop that prints numbers 1 to 20, but only prints even numbers. Use a conditional statement inside the loop.

```python
```

## Question 2: Input Validation Loop
Create a while loop that asks the user to enter their age. Keep asking until they enter a valid age (between 1 and 120), then print "Valid age entered!".

```python
```

## Question 3: Menu System
Create a simple menu system with a while loop that:
1. Shows options: "1. Say Hello", "2. Say Goodbye", "3. Exit"
2. Takes user input
3. Performs the appropriate action
4. Continues until user chooses to exit

```python
```

## Question 4: Data Processing with Conditions
Create a list of numbers `[15, 23, 8, 42, 7, 14, 3, 9]` and use a loop to:
- Print "Even" for even numbers
- Print "Odd" for odd numbers
- Skip numbers less than 10
- Stop when you find a number greater than 40

```python
```

## Question 5: Nested Logic
Create a program that simulates a simple ATM:
- Start with balance = 1000
- Show menu: "1. Check Balance", "2. Withdraw", "3. Deposit", "4. Exit"
- Handle withdrawals (check if sufficient funds)
- Handle deposits (add to balance)
- Continue until user exits

```python
```

## Question 6: Error Handling
Create a function that safely divides two numbers. It should:
- Check if both inputs are numbers
- Check for division by zero
- Return the result or an error message
- Test with various inputs (valid numbers, zero, non-numbers)

```python
```

## Question 7: State Machine
Create a simple traffic light simulator:
- States: "red", "yellow", "green"
- Start with "red"
- User can press Enter to advance to next state
- Cycle: red → green → yellow → red
- Exit when user types "quit"

```python
```

## Question 8: Complex Decision Tree
Create a program that recommends activities based on:
- Weather: "sunny", "rainy", "cloudy"
- Temperature: hot (>25), warm (15-25), cold (<15)
- Day: "weekend" or "weekday"

Print appropriate activity recommendations for different combinations.

```python
```

## Question 9: Data Filtering
Create a list of student records with name, age, and grade:
```python
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 19, "grade": 92},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 21, "grade": 78},
    {"name": "Diana", "age": 20, "grade": 96}
]
```

Use loops and conditionals to:
- Find students with grade >= 90
- Find students aged 20
- Calculate average grade
- Print summary statistics

```python
```

## Question 10: Game Logic
Create a simple number guessing game with multiple rounds:
- Generate random number between 1-10
- Give user 3 attempts to guess
- Track total score across rounds
- Ask if user wants to play again
- Show final score when they quit

```python
```

## Bonus Challenge: Shopping Cart System
Create a shopping cart system that:
- Allows adding/removing items
- Calculates total cost
- Applies discounts based on total amount
- Handles inventory (limited quantities)
- Shows cart contents and total

```python
```

## Advanced Challenge: Text Adventure Game
Create a simple text adventure with:
- Multiple rooms/locations
- Items to collect
- Simple commands (go, take, use, look)
- Win/lose conditions
- Save/load functionality

```python
```

## Expert Challenge: Data Analysis Tool
Create a program that analyzes a dataset of sales records:
- Read sales data (product, quantity, price, date)
- Calculate total sales by product
- Find best/worst selling products
- Calculate monthly trends
- Generate summary report

```python
```
