# Conditionals - Practice Questions

## Question 1: Basic If Statement
Create a variable `temperature = 25` and write an if statement that prints "It's hot!" if the temperature is greater than 20.

```python
```

## Question 2: If-Else Statement
Create a variable `age = 17` and write an if-else statement that prints "You can vote" if age is 18 or older, otherwise prints "You cannot vote yet".

```python
```

## Question 3: Multiple Conditions with Elif
Create a variable `score = 78` and write a program that assigns grades based on the score:
- 90 or above: "A"
- 80-89: "B"
- 70-79: "C"
- 60-69: "D"
- Below 60: "F"

Print the grade.

```python
```

## Question 4: Logical AND Operator
Create variables `username = "admin"` and `password = "secret123"`. Write a program that prints "Access granted" only if both the username is "admin" AND the password is "secret123", otherwise print "Access denied".

```python
```

## Question 5: Logical OR Operator
Create a variable `day = "Saturday"`. Write a program that prints "Weekend!" if the day is "Saturday" OR "Sunday", otherwise print "Weekday".

```python
```

## Question 6: NOT Operator
Create a variable `is_raining = False`. Write a program that prints "Good weather for outdoor activities" if it's NOT raining, otherwise print "Stay indoors".

```python
```

## Question 7: Nested Conditionals
Create variables `age = 20` and `has_license = True`. Write nested if statements that:
1. First check if age is 18 or older
2. If yes, check if they have a license
3. Print appropriate messages for each scenario

```python
```

## Question 8: Checking List Membership
Create a list `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]` and a variable `fruit = "banana"`. Write a program that checks if the fruit is in the list and prints "Found in the list" or "Not found in the list".

```python
```

## Question 9: Range Validation
Create a variable `number = 15`. Write a program that checks if the number is between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and prints "Valid number" or "Number must be between 1 and 100".

```python
```

## Question 10: Complex Conditional Logic
Create variables for a simple login system:
- `username = "user123"`
- `password = "mypass456"`
- `is_active = True`
- `login_attempts = 2`

Write a program that grants access only if:
- Username is "user123" AND password is "mypass456" AND account is active
- AND login attempts are less than 3

Print "Login successful" or "Login failed" with an appropriate reason.

```python
```

## Bonus Challenge: Grade Calculator
Create a program that takes a student's scores for three subjects (math, science, english) and calculates their overall grade:

- Calculate the average score
- Assign letter grades: A (90+), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (<60)
- Print the average score and letter grade
- Add a special message if the student got all A's

```python
```

## Advanced Challenge: Password Strength Checker
Create a program that checks password strength based on these criteria:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Contains at least one lowercase letter
- Contains at least one digit
- Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

Print the strength level: "Weak", "Medium", or "Strong" based on how many criteria are met.

```python
```
