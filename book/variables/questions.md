# Variables - Practice Questions

## Question 1: Variable Creation
Create a variable called `student_name` and assign it the value "Sarah Johnson". Then print the variable.


## Question 2: Multiple Data Types
Create variables to store the following information about a book:
- Title: "Python Programming"
- Author: "Jane Smith"
- Pages: 350
- Price: 29.99
- Available: True


## Question 3: Variable Naming
Which of the following are valid variable names in Python? Explain why the invalid ones are incorrect.

```python
# Check each of these:
my_variable = 10
2nd_place = "silver"
user-name = "john"
_total = 100
class = "beginner"
myVariable = 20
```

## Question 4: Variable Reassignment
Start with a variable `x = 5`. Then:
1. Add 10 to it
2. Multiply the result by 2
3. Print the final value


## Question 5: String Concatenation
Create two variables: `first_name = "Alex"` and `last_name = "Brown"`. Create a third variable called `full_name` that combines them with a space in between. Print the result.


## Question 6: Mathematical Operations
Create variables `a = 15` and `b = 4`. Calculate and store the results of:
- Addition (a + b)
- Subtraction (a - b)
- Multiplication (a * b)
- Division (a / b)
- Floor division (a // b)
- Modulus (a % b)

Print all results.


## Question 7: Multiple Assignment
Use multiple assignment to create three variables in one line:
- `red` should be 255
- `green` should be 128
- `blue` should be 64

Then print all three values.


## Question 8: Type Checking
Create variables with different data types and use the `type()` function to check their types:
- A string variable
- An integer variable
- A float variable
- A boolean variable

Print the type of each variable.


## Question 9: Variable Scope Practice
Create a global variable `global_count = 0`. Then create a function called `increment_count()` that:
1. Creates a local variable `local_count = 5`
2. Prints both the global and local variables
3. Returns the sum of both

Call the function and print its return value.


## Question 10: Real-world Application
Create variables to represent a shopping cart:
- `item1_name = "Laptop"`
- `item1_price = 999.99`
- `item2_name = "Mouse"`
- `item2_price = 25.50`
- `tax_rate = 0.08`

Calculate and print:
1. The subtotal (sum of both items)
2. The tax amount (subtotal × tax_rate)
3. The total cost (subtotal + tax)


## Bonus Challenge
Create a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Use variables to store:
- The Celsius temperature (you choose the value)
- The conversion formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32
- The result

Print a message like: "25 degrees Celsius is 77.0 degrees Fahrenheit"
