# Loops - Practice Questions

## Question 1: Basic For Loop
Create a list `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]` and use a for loop to print each fruit on a separate line.

```python
```

## Question 2: Range Function
Use a for loop with `range()` to print numbers from 1 to 10.

```python
```

## Question 3: While Loop Counter
Create a while loop that prints numbers from 0 to 4, then stops.

```python
```

## Question 4: Sum of Numbers
Create a list `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and use a for loop to calculate and print the sum of all numbers.

```python
```

## Question 5: Finding Maximum
Create a list `scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]` and use a for loop to find and print the highest score.

```python
```

## Question 6: Break Statement
Create a for loop that iterates through numbers 1 to 10, but stops (using `break`) when it reaches 7.

```python
```

## Question 7: Continue Statement
Create a for loop that prints numbers 1 to 10, but skips (using `continue`) all even numbers.

```python
```

## Question 8: Nested Loops
Create nested for loops to print a 3x3 grid of asterisks (*). Each row should have 3 asterisks.

```python
```

## Question 9: String Iteration
Create a string `word = "Python"` and use a for loop to print each character and its position (index).

```python
```

## Question 10: While Loop with User Input
Create a while loop that asks the user to enter a number. Keep asking until they enter 0, then print "Thank you!" and exit.

```python
```

## Bonus Challenge: Multiplication Table
Create a program that prints a multiplication table from 1 to 5. The output should look like:
```
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 2 = 2
...
5 × 5 = 25
```

```python
```

## Advanced Challenge: Number Guessing Game
Create a simple number guessing game:
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 10
2. Ask the user to guess the number
3. Give hints ("too high" or "too low")
4. Count the number of attempts
5. Congratulate when they guess correctly

```python
```

## Expert Challenge: Prime Number Finder
Create a program that finds all prime numbers between 2 and 50 using nested loops.

```python
```
